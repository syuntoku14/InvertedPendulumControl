In order to activate the simulation tools, run:
```
addpath('/home/syuntoku14/OneDrive/matlab/mfiles/ip_toolbox_1.0.2/iptools')
```

Also, you need to run 'cdip_para.m' or 'adip_para' to configure some parameters.
In addition to that, z_0, theta_0, dz_0, dtheta_0 are required for cart_driven 
and theta1_0, theta2_0, dtheta1_0, dtheta2_0 are required for arm_driven.

Example:
```
addpath('/home/syuntoku14/OneDrive/matlab/mfiles/ip_toolbox_1.0.2/iptools')
cdip_para
z_0 = 0;
theta_0 = 0;
dz_0 = 0;
dtheta_0 = 0;
```

Then, run the simulation. You can see the animation by:
```
theta = phi + pi;
cdip_anime
```

The animation tool requires only theta, z and t. 
Here, theta is the pendulum angle from vertical (up) and clockwise.
You can save the animation just typing the following code:
```
save_avi('inv_pend.avi', 10, frame)
```

If you wish to convert avi to mp4, type the following command.

```
for filename in *.avi; do ffmpeg -i $filename -strict -2 ${filename%.avi}.mp4; done
```
